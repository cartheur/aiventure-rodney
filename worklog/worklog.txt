The Rodney worklog: This is the worklog for the assembly of Heiserman’s 1979 robot.

What started as an opportunity to study the deepest aspects of the computer with a nostalgia-check on wire-wrapping, has evolved into a full-blown conspiracy-check: Why during this era did the big manufacturers (Intel, Motorola) advise strongly against self-programming machines when Turing (whom everyone in the business fawns-over) clearly stated in 1947: "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience"? Why the dichotomy? Grok says:

Intel’s advice was articulated in technical documentation like the Intel 8085 Microprocessor User’s Manual and related application notes, which emphasized writing clear, maintainable assembly code. While self-modifying code could theoretically be used on the 8085 for optimization (e.g., dynamically altering jump addresses), its risks—unpredictable execution, debugging difficulties, and reduced reliability—outweighed benefits in most cases, leading Intel to recommend against it.

    1117: Although this project has been (more or less) around since 2019, only now am I bringing it into focus. I have assembled the work-area on the human-machine interface and the next step is to lightly glue the plastic LED bezels/mounts to this. Did a test with A0 and it seems well-enough.

    1408: The stress-test of the glue hold did not go so well. But this is still a place to solve this problem. I went ahead and glued the remaining bezels with a bit of a twist to set the glue more evenly around the radius. Will give it 24 hours to see how it sets.

    1613: After some slacktime, I resumed work the 22nd of December 2023 on the mounts for the two Vector boards (a decision not to use the smaller ones) and a hinge-based smaller board to hold the beginnings of the I/O components, pretty much just the 8226 bus transceivers. It took some time to get a design in-place and eight prototypes before four properly-sized mounts for the boards were correct. The hinge went well in a single go, as well as the bar support.

    948: I have come to the realization that there is work to be done on my ideal-metal initiative here in 8-bit land. Any manifestations of learning should be visible at this level. I need to contemplate further.

    2005: Completed the extended contemplation on this topic. Not easy as it is obfuscated and given how the world looks and operates, a pretty good probability was hidden for a reason. But not going to point fingers or assign shade, just investigate if relevant and what it looks like. Now we can move forward.

    931: Created a Kanban board and will capture the work from Jan-2024, as a way to track progress and to create an inflection point.
    944: Addressed the self-programming context with Grok and added a new section for this feature so that I can keenly understand its implications and implementation.
    1043: Cleaned-up extraneous programs and files.
    1057: For the publication and referential purposes, added the example that I have been discussing with Grok.
    1216: Created the publication starting-point.
    1223: Refined the repo and getting a bit lost in task management.
    1334: Am insisting upon only half-day at the computer. After a break, will attend to the UI task.
    1709: Reviewing the what is required to progress with the Chapter 5 Task.
    1824: Made a drawing of the cable pattern toward the metal panel - PZ202, PZ203, and PZ204 in the book.
20.05.2025
    948: Resuming where I left-off yesterday.
    1146: Wasted two hours working on a "8085 trainer" circuit design, based on some late-night thoughts. While AI seems helpful, it's total shit since it cannot close the loop.
    1216: Created the .md page for the steps thusfar for 5.
    1253: Added future chapter work and a means to present results clearly and cleanly.
    1301: Made a "working version" of the wiring figure with a grey background as the white was just too bright.
    1531: Amended the panel drawing and still have to reconcile the +5v as it might be errantly in the diagram.
