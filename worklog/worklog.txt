The Rodney worklog: This is the worklog for the assembly of Heiserman’s 1979 robot.

What started as an opportunity to study the deepest aspects of the computer with a nostalgia-check on wire-wrapping, has evolved into a full-blown conspiracy-check: Why during this era did the big manufacturers (Intel, Motorola) advise strongly against self-programming machines when Turing (whom everyone in the business fawns-over) clearly stated in 1947: "What we want is a machine that can learn from experience"? Why the dichotomy? Grok says:

Intel’s advice was articulated in technical documentation like the Intel 8085 Microprocessor User’s Manual and related application notes, which emphasized writing clear, maintainable assembly code. While self-modifying code could theoretically be used on the 8085 for optimization (e.g., dynamically altering jump addresses), its risks—unpredictable execution, debugging difficulties, and reduced reliability—outweighed benefits in most cases, leading Intel to recommend against it.

    1117: Although this project has been (more or less) around since 2019, only now am I bringing it into focus. I have assembled the work-area on the human-machine interface and the next step is to lightly glue the plastic LED bezels/mounts to this. Did a test with A0 and it seems well-enough.

    1408: The stress-test of the glue hold did not go so well. But this is still a place to solve this problem. I went ahead and glued the remaining bezels with a bit of a twist to set the glue more evenly around the radius. Will give it 24 hours to see how it sets.

    1613: After some slacktime, I resumed work the 22nd of December 2023 on the mounts for the two Vector boards (a decision not to use the smaller ones) and a hinge-based smaller board to hold the beginnings of the I/O components, pretty much just the 8226 bus transceivers. It took some time to get a design in-place and eight prototypes before four properly-sized mounts for the boards were correct. The hinge went well in a single go, as well as the bar support.
    1617: Now I want to formally prepare the full BoM and align as I have a pending Mouser order that needs to be submitted tomorrow.
    1630: Formalizing this document will take some time. Let me pull the parts, mostly the resistors and capacitors, and check that the list is complete.
    1817: Just finished the BoM for the M6x09-I-SBC, as a template for how to do such in the future. I would really like to have each board fully assembled by machine. Now to pull the parts and see what Rodney maybe missing.
    1852: Reorganized the repository. Now is a bit clearer and more pragmatic. Will use the tables and the parts list sheet to know if I have all the bits. The big question is where did I get the DIP24-600?
    2110: Completed the BoM based on the tables from the book. Added a 32-pin PROM and the appropriate wirewrap socket for the additional storage via cartridge or tape. Let’s see what shakes. The list is ready and will cross-check tomorrow before sending the order.

    1603: As, essentially, this project is a historical revisitation – not unlike the intent of spiritualists of the 1890s – with an emphasis on embodiment (very much so) I have elected to include the oldest discovered version of 86-DOS (predecessor of MS-DOS) that was an outgrowth of the 8-bit CP/M but targeted the new 16-bit 8086 in this GitHub repository. The idea is that software is very much a part of this journey and although the i8085 is capable clearly of CP/M, given its unique UI, this will only be explored in terms of the program monitor that I have planned to be burned into the ROM, once I place it. I am contemplating a change in design to include it based on the design principles I have codified for the 6x09-II-SBC project.

    948: I have come to the realization that there is work to be done on my ideal-metal initiative here in 8-bit land.

    2005: This project is back to active status.
19.05.2025
    931: Created a Kanban board and will capture the work from Jan-2024, as a way to track progress and to create an inflection point.
