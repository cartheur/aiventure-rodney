## Chapter 5: Front panel Program/Test assembly

While Rodney is essentially a self-programming machine, there is still a need for entering a small selection of programs from the outside world. An animal might be born knowing exactly nothing about how to cope with its environment, but even so, it is born with an underlying reflex mechanism that helps the learning process begin.

In order to accomplish this, a set of three cables extend from a set of pins to another board:

Where the corresponding wiring pattern is thusly:

Using the colors from the lamps to show where the wires connect.
