# Example 8085 Assembly Program with Self-Modifying Code

_The following is Grok output from my query of what Heiserman is claiming in his book:_

This Intel 8085 assembly program demonstrates self-modifying code, illustrating runtime adaptability as a crude mechanism for dynamic behavior, aligning with Turing’s idea of machines adapting to experience. It modifies a `JMP` instruction’s target address based on an input condition, while highlighting risks that led Intel to discourage such practices for the 8085.

## Program Description

- **Purpose**: Reads an input value at memory address `2000H` (e.g., simulating sensor data). If the value is ≥ 50, it modifies a `JMP` instruction to point to `HIGH_ROUTINE` (outputs “HIGH”). If < 50, it points to `LOW_ROUTINE` (outputs “LOW”).
- **Self-Modification**: Overwrites the `JMP` instruction’s 16-bit address at runtime to redirect program flow.
- **Context**: Shows adaptability but underscores risks like unpredictability, debugging complexity, and potential memory overwrites.

## How It Demonstrates Self-Modifying Code

1. **Dynamic Modification**:
   - The `JMP_MOD` instruction (initially `JMP 0000H`) is overwritten with the `JMP` opcode (`0C3H`) and the 16-bit address of either `LOW_ROUTINE` or `HIGH_ROUTINE` at `JMP_MOD`, `JMP_MOD+1`, and `JMP_MOD+2`.
   - This redirects program flow based on the input, showcasing runtime adaptability.

2. **Adaptability**:
   - The program adapts by selecting a routine based on the input value at `2000H` (e.g., 60 → `HIGH_ROUTINE`, 40 → `LOW_ROUTINE`), mimicking a response to environmental input, akin to Turing’s experiential learning concept.

3. **Risks Highlighted**:
   - **Unpredictability**: If the 8085 fetches the `JMP` instruction before modification completes, it may execute the outdated `JMP 0000H`, causing incorrect behavior.
   - **Debugging Difficulty**: The dynamic `JMP` target complicates tracing program flow, especially with 1980s tools like in-circuit emulators.
   - **Memory Overwrite Risk**: Errors in address calculations could overwrite critical code or data, reflecting Intel’s reliability concerns.

## Why This Is Crude

- **Not True Learning**: The modification is predefined (choosing between two routines), not a generalized response learned from experience, unlike Turing’s vision of neural-like learning.
- **Limited Scope**: Adaptability is limited to switching between two predefined paths, not a scalable learning mechanism.
- **Hardware Constraints**: The 8085’s 64 KB memory and simple fetch-execute cycle restrict complex self-modification.

## Notes

- **Simulation**: Assumes an input value at `2000H` (e.g., set by external hardware) and writes output to `2001H`. In real systems, I/O ports might be used.
- **Assembly Syntax**: Uses standard 8085 mnemonics, compatible with assemblers like Intel’s ASM80 or modern cross-assemblers.
- **Testing**: Set a value at `2000H` (e.g., 60 for high, 40 for low) and run on an 8085 emulator (e.g., Jubin’s 8085 Simulator). Check `2001H` for ‘H’ or ‘L’.

This example illustrates self-modifying code’s potential for runtime adaptability while highlighting its risks and limitations, reinforcing why Intel advised against it for the 8085.
