# aiventure-rodney
A project to revitalize and learn by Heiserman's 1979 robotics DIY.

## What is in here?

This repository contains a revitialization of the idea of a self-programming robot coupled with the ambition to learn the deepest aspects of how a computer functions at its most basic level.

The book, written in 1978, leverages an Intel 8085 8-bit (the very last CPU made to this specification) where the reader builds up the system from scratch including the logic, buffers, and memory systems. Additionally, a tape-drive storage interface is described. Not just an historical curiousity, Rodney continues to teach readers by having them build one step at a time.

The challenge of this project is to make a build of the microcomputer system to examine the merit of the "self-programming" claim. On tiis rests *everything* claimed 'A.I.'. This is a total misnomer. I will be making videos to this effect.
