# aiventure-rodney

A project revolving around Heiserman's 1979 robotics proposition. The focus is _scratch-building_ an i8085 computer. To explore self-learning programs, a game will need to be devised for the computer to play.

## What is in here?

This repository contains a revitialization of the idea of a self-programming robot coupled with the ambition to learn the deepest aspects of how a computer functions at its most basic level. The book, written in 1978, leverages an Intel 8085 8-bit (the very last CPU made to this specification) where the reader builds up the system from scratch including the logic, buffers, and memory systems. Additionally, a tape-drive storage interface is described. Not just an historical curiousity, Rodney continues to teach readers by having them build one step at a time.

The challenge of this project is to make a build of the microcomputer system to examine the merit of the "self-programming" claim. On tiis rests *everything* claimed 'A.I.'. This is a total misnomer. I will be making videos to this effect.

Also here is the earliest 86-DOS version to be [published](/software/ReadMe.md). CP/M is a concerted effort going forward.

### Progress

The foundations in metal have been constructed and starting the design phase.
